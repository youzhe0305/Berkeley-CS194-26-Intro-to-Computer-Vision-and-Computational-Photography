# Berkeley-Intro-to-Computer-Vision-and-Computational-Photography

Course Code: CS194-26

## Project1

Combine align R,G,B channel pictures as one color picture

## Project2

### Part 1

Through binarize, gaussian binarize, DoG to find the edge of photos

### Part 2

1. sharpen image by enhance high pass(edge)
2. hybrid two image by different frequency
3. combine two image and eliminate the edge by tmulti-resolution-spline

### Project 3

1. compute homography matrix with corresponse points between images
2. use homography matrix to warp image, get mid-way image
3. use mid-way image to build a GIF
4. try to compute & get mean face

### Project 4-1

1. denote corresponse points in different images. The images are same scene with different shooting angle.
2. compute homography matrix with corresponse points between images
2. use homography matrix to warp images and stack them to a wide angle image.

### Project 4-2

1. Implement SIFT Algorithm to do auto-stiching (auto find corresponse points rather than manually denote)
2. use RANSAC alogorithm to delete abnormal points (outliers), ensure points quality.

### Project 5

It's easier than DLP course's homework, so I didn't implement it.
